## Hello, I'm Kaynen.

Even though I hail from tiny Prentice, WI, I've always had huge aspirations for my life, both personally and professionally. Some of my fondest childhood memories were playing with my parents' original Macintosh computer. I went to and received a degree from the University of Wisconsin - Stevens Point in Web and Digital Media Development and worked as a Junior Web Developer for Team Absolute, Webmaster at Wooddale Church and now as a Senior Developer for Blue Door Consulting. With over a decade of web development, audio/video/graphic editing and marketing/communication experience, how can I help you?
